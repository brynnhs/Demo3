# PsychoPy

PsychoPy is an open-source Python coded software that allows for the creation of online or lab-based psych/neuro experiments. From the [Stroop task](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV6qhuQgsiI) to a recreation of [Super Mario Bros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISHAnDF4Xkc); the possibilities with PyschoPy are almost limitless. 

Unlike Python packages like Numpy or MatPlotlib, you will have to download PsychoPy as its software. It's fairly intuitive; you can access it [here](https://www.psychopy.org/download.html). 

## Why PsychoPy?

Through NESC 3505, we've learned how to effectively analyze and display neural data using Python and a variety of its packages (Numpy, MatPlotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, and MNE). But how can we actually create unique stimulus presentations and collect this data? PsychoPy offers an easy-to-use Python-based builder interface with built in actions and loops. You can also use its coding window to directly code the experiment yourself. PyschoPy offers the ability to create audio and visual stimuli and interaction with external devices, such as EEG, eye-tracking, and FMRI.

Once you've created and run your participants through the experiment in PsychoPy you can then export the participants data and upload it into your IDE. You're then all set to use your Neural Data Science skills to analyze and visualize your findings. 

PsychoPy is kinda fun to mess around with and see what you can create. It will also be a great tool for a lot of students going into integrated and honours projects, where you may have to develop your own stimulus presentations. 

## Resources 

### Tutorials
* Jason Ozubko offers a two part series diving into the basics of PsychoPy. This series is extremely detailed and very well done. You should be set up with a solid understanding of PsychoPy once completed. I suggest you follow along with Jason in these tutorials so that you can get a feel for how the builder interface is set up. ([Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSv60zgQlB8) and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZDVOfGFwWI))
* Once you have the basics down, you should follow along with one of PscyhoPy's own tutorials. You can find a tutorial for the Stroop Task experiment [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV6qhuQgsiI). If you've watched Jason's videos, try running or creating the Stroop task on your own or by following [this](https://workshops.psychopy.org/tutorials/stroop.html) article for more of a challenge. 

### Discussion Board
If you run into a bump in creating your experiment, feel free to hit up the [PsychoPy discussion board](https://discourse.psychopy.org/c/online/14). 

### Premade Experiments
PsychoPy tasks are uploaded to the website [Pavlovia](https://pavlovia.org/explore?sort=DEFAULT) to be run participants online and / or used by other researchers. You can find many different experiments, look at how they were coded, download them to use on PsychoPy yourself, and test run them. When reading about a new kind of task in literature, it's helpful to look on Pavlovia so you can run through the stimulus presentation yourself to better visualize the task. 

### Books and Articles 
* If you’re more of a reader than a viewer, PyschoPy has its own textbook detailing how its own how to’s. You can buy the textbook [here](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/building-experiments-in-psychopy/book253480) and you definitely cannot find it for free [here](https://ca1lib.org/book/11813584/6fb110).
* You could also read [this](https://snuling.com/materials/SWELL-2020/Gyuhwan_Lee_PsychopyTutorial_201222.pdf) article-tutorial on PsychoPy.

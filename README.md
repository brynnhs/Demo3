# Intro to Psychopy

PsychoPy is an open-source Python coded software that allows for the creation of online or lab-based psych/neuro experiments. From the [Stroop task](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV6qhuQgsiI) to a recreation of [Super Mario Bros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISHAnDF4Xkc); the possibilities with PyschoPy are almost limitless. 

Unlike Python packages like Numpy or MatPlotlib, you will have to download PsychoPy. It's fairly intuitive; you can access it [here](https://www.psychopy.org/download.html). 

## Why PsychoPy?

Through NESC 3505, we've learned how to effectively analyze and display neural data using Python and a variety of its packages (Numpy, MatPlotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, and MNE). But how can we actually create unique stimulus presentations and collect this data? PsychoPy offers an easy-to-use Python-based builder interface with built in actions and loops. You can also use its coding window to directly code the experiment yourself. PyschoPy offers the ability to create audio and visual stimuli and interaction with external devices, such as EEG, eye-tracking, and FMRI. Using 

Once you've created and run your participants through the experiment in PsychoPy you can then export the participants data and upload it into your IDE. You're then all set to use your Neural Data Science skills to analyze and visualize your findings. 

## Resources 

### Tutorials
* Jason Ozubko offers a two part series diving into the basics of PsychoPy. This series is extremely detailed and very well done. You should be set up with a solid understanding of PsychoPy once completed. I suggest you follow along with Jason in these tutorials so that you can get a feel for how the builder interface is set up. ([Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSv60zgQlB8) and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZDVOfGFwWI))
* Once you have the basics down, you should follow along with one of PscyhoPy's own tutorials. You can find a tutorial for the Stroop Task experiment [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV6qhuQgsiI). If you've watched Jason's videos, try running or creating the Stroop task on your own or by following [this](https://workshops.psychopy.org/tutorials/stroop.html) article for more of a challenge. 

### Discussion Board
If you run into a bump in creating your experiment, feel free to hit up the [PsychoPy discussion board](https://discourse.psychopy.org/c/online/14). 

### Books and Articles 
If you’re more of a reader than a viewer, PyschoPy has its own textbook detailing how its own how to’s. You can buy the textbook [here](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/building-experiments-in-psychopy/book253480) and you definitely cannot find it for free [here](https://ca1lib.org/book/11813584/6fb110).

Intro to Psychopy

PsychoPy is an open-source Python coded software that allows for the creation of online or lab-based psych/neuro experiments. From the Stroop task to a recreation of Super Mario Bros (tutorial here); the possibilities with PyschoPy are almost limitless. 

Unlike Python packages like Numpy or MatPlotlib, you will have to download PsychoPy.
